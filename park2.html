<h3><ul><li><p>Gir National Park in Gujarat is the only place in the world where you can spot lions roaming free in the wild.</ul></li></h3>

<h3><ul><li><p>The real discovery channel of India is situated approximately 65 Kms South East of Junagarh District. The Government notified the large geographical extent of Sasan Gir as wildlife sanctuary on 18th September, 1965 in order to conserve the Asiatic Lion. </p></ul></li></h3>

<h3><ul><li><p>It covers total area of 1412 square kilometers of which 258 Km forms the core area of the National Park.</p></ul></li></h3>

<h3><ul><li><p> Indiscriminate hunting by the people of Junagarh led to their decrease in population drastically, while they were completely wiped out from the other parts of Asia. It was the kind effort of Nawabs of Junagarh who protected the queen royalty in his own private hunting grounds. </p></ul></li></h3>
<h3><ul><li><p>Later in due course of time Department of Forest Officials came forward to protect the worldâ€™s most threatened species. From a population of approximately 20 lions in 1913, they have risen to a comfortable 523 according to 2015 census. There are 106 male, 201 female and 213 sub-adult lions in the wilderness of these four districts.</p></ul></li></h3>
